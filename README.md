# polygenic
This is the repository of the tree-problem project. I recently compared my proposed model with the [Galton height dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T0HSJ1) (R^2 = 0.81). I'm beginning to start work on writing a paper in latex for journal submission. 


## How to use
* To see an explanation of the project, go to the [Tree Project Explainer](tree_project_explainer.ipynb) notebook. 
* To see the module that does all the behind-the-scenes work, open the [Tree Project Module](tree_functions.py) file.
* To see what I'm working on in order to add to the module, open the [Tree Project Work](tree_project_work.ipynb) notebook.
* To see my work with the [Francis Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) data, go to the [Galton](galton.ipynb) notebook.
* To see the coin flip analogy and how the central limit theorem explains why polygenic genes fall into a normal distribution, go to the [Coin Flip Analogy](coin_flip_analogy.ipynb) notebook.


As of March 14, the LaTeX paper is in its very early stages and doesn't include the figures, etc. However, I expect to be making progress on it rapidly.
