# polygenic
This is the repository of the tree-problem project. I recently compared my proposed model with the [Galton height dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T0HSJ1) (R^2 = 0.81). I'm beginning to start work on writing a paper in latex for journal submission. 


## How to use
* I'm in the process of writing up a paper, sometimes it doesn't fully load on mobile when viewed in this repository, so if you would like to see the paper, [click here](https://jessebmurray.github.io/project_files/polygenic_paper.pdf). 
* To see the module that does all the behind-the-scenes work, open the [Tree Project Module](tree_functions.py) file.
* To see my work with the Francis Galton [data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T0HSJ1), go to the [Galton](galton.ipynb) notebook.
* To see the coin flip analogy and how the central limit theorem explains why polygenic genes fall into a normal distribution, go to the [Coin Flip Analogy](coin_flip_analogy.ipynb) notebook.
* An early (first-draft explanation of the project, is i the [Tree Project Explainer](tree_project_explainer.ipynb) notebook.
