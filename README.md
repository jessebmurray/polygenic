# Polygenic
The paper that I'm writing for this project can be [found here](https://jessebmurray.github.io/project_files/polygenic_paper.pdf). 

This is the repository of the tree-problem project. 


## For those interested...
* To see the module that does all the behind-the-scenes work, open the [Tree Project Module](tree_functions.py) file.
* To see my work with the Francis Galton [data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T0HSJ1), go to the [Galton](galton.ipynb) notebook.
* To see the coin flip analogy and how the central limit theorem explains why polygenic genes fall into a normal distribution, go to the [Coin Flip Analogy](coin_flip_analogy.ipynb) notebook.
