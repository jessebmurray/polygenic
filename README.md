# polygenic
This is the repository of the tree-problem project. I've recently started work on assessing my proposed model with the [Galton height dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T0HSJ1).

## How to use
* To see an explanation of the project, go to the [Tree Project Explainer](tree_project_explainer.ipynb) notebook. 
* To see the module that does all the behind-the-scenes work, open the [Tree Project Module](tree_problem_0.py) file.
* To see what I'm working on in order to add to the module, open the [Tree Project Work](tree_project_work.ipynb) notebook.
* To see my work with the [Francis Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) data, go to the [Galton](galton.ipynb) notebook.
* To see the coin flip analogy and central limit theorem about why polygenic genes fall into a normal distribution, go to the [Coin Flip Analogy](coin_flip_analogy.ipynb) notebook.
