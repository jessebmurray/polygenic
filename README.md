### Browsing the Code

**Caution**: The parameter *s* in the paper was previously called *r_s*, and is denoted in the code as such.

Often, `.ipynb` files take a while to load on GitHub, instead, *please use the following links to browse the main Jupyter notebooks*.

### Data sources

##### Pearson mother-daughter data from the R package `alr3`

##### Pearson father-son data from Patrick Breheny at the University of Iowa

*"This data set has had a small amount of random uniform noise added to it to render it continuous"*.
